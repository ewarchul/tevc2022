# TEVC paper plan

## Milestones

1. Get working version of CMA-ES in C++
2. Implement PPMF in CMA-ES
3. Reproduce past reasearch results from CEC 2021
4. Investigate impact of dimensionality for PPMF (so called Large-Scale Problems)
5. Find optimal step-size for PPMF
6. Investigate PPMF behavior on random functions
7. Investigate PPMF performance on given function set
8. Investigate PPMF on bbob benchmark
9. Write paper
